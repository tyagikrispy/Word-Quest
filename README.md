# Word Quest

Word Quest is a board game project that uses tries, depth-first search (DFS), and backtracking algorithms to find valid words from a given set of words that can be formed using a board of characters.



## Project Description

The objective is to find and form as many words as possible from the given set of words by connecting adjacent characters on the board. The game utilizes a trie data structure to efficiently store and validate the dictionary of words. It employs a combination of depth-first search and backtracking algorithms to explore the board, searching for valid word combinations.



## Features

Integration of tries for efficient word validation and search.

Utilization of DFS and backtracking algorithms for board exploration.



## Input Format

Firstly, we need to provide n(number of rows) and m(number of coloumns). 
Next, Enter all the characters present in the board.
Then, provide the number of words.
Provide all the words.
